# Ronin WordPress Theme 

The Ronin Wordpress theme is a complete custom WordPress theme that allows for users not only to blog, but to also update the text and images on the home page. The design was from a template found on Colorlib.com. It features a nice landing page that contains a features, testimonial, and blog section. 

## Getting Started

First you will need to have WordPress installed either on your local machine or on your server. Then you can simple download the files and upload them to your site!

### Prerequisites

If you plan on changing any of the SASS code, then you will want to have a compiler ready. I recommend using Koala if you have never used a SASS compiler before. 

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-End Framework
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
* [Underscore](https://underscores.me/) - WordPress theme starter template
